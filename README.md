# MyCantina

Mycantina is an app to manage and record your wine collection.

This is a rough web app born as final project for my TAFE Certificate IV in programming, and it is, therefore, barely usable, but it has lots of sweat and passion behind â€” as many learning projects. Maybe one day I'll make a proper thing out of it.

It's made with these technologies:
* Visual Studio 2015
* Entity Framework
* ASP.NET MVC 5
* C#
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Handlebars.js
* xUnit
